# SimplyRandom
Simple C++ pseudo-random library that includes functions to randomly generate numbers in a simple and intuitive way

-Currently uses the mersenne twister algorithm from the standard c++11 library to generate random numbers.
-DO NOT use for security or cryptographic purposes as this library is not robust or secure enough to generate truely random numbers
for those puposes. If used for these purposes I take no liability for any damages caused.
